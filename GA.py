Requirements
- Implement a genetic algorithm solving the F18 and F19 problems
- Implement an evolution strategy solving the F18 and F19 problems
- Submit at least two files 'studentnumber1_studentnumber2_GA.py' and 'studentnumber1_studentnumber2_ES.py'.
- Additional files of other functions are allowed. Please make sure we can get results by running 'python *_GA.py' and 'python *_ES.py' without additional arguments.
- Submit a report introducing your algorithms and presenting the experimental results.

Task 1: Genetic Algorithm
Some hints:
- Which variators (i.e., mutation and crossover) and selection operators will you use?
- Whatâ€™s your suggestion for the parameter settings (e.g., population size, mutation rate, etc.)?
