Requirements
- Implement a genetic algorithm solving the F18 and F19 problems
- Implement an evolution strategy solving the F18 and F19 problems
- Submit at least two files 'studentnumber1_studentnumber2_GA.py' and 'studentnumber1_studentnumber2_ES.py'.
- Additional files of other functions are allowed. Please make sure we can get results by running 'python *_GA.py' and 'python *_ES.py' without additional arguments.
- Submit a report introducing your algorithms and presenting the experimental results.

"""
Task 2: Evolution Strategy
- How to handle the representation of binary/discrete variables while applying evolution strategies?
- What encoding and decoding methods will you use?
- Which variators (e.g., one-� mutation, correlated mutation, discrete recombination, etc) and selectionmoperators will you use?
- What’s your suggestion for the parameter settings (e.g., population size, step size, etc.)?
